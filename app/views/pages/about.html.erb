      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>I began my career as a sound designer, making silent cartoons less silent. After brief asperations of becoming a web designer, I became a developer because Ruby was more enjoyable than Photoshop. I now (ab)use my skills to make <a href="http://blog.edwardloveall.com/post/134723720862/an-incredibly-dumb-way-to-make-sentences">Markov chains</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gabebw/udp_chat">chat clients</a>, and <a href="https://hotlinewebring.club">webrings</a>. "Edward" would be worth 11 points in Scrabble if it were allowed.</p>
